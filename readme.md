# Grenoble Métropole Trees

Project to predict the year of plantation of trees in Grenoble Métropole


## Problem Definition

The city of Grenoble takes the management of its green spaces very seriously. It plans to plant more than 1,000 trees over the next few decades to help citizens cope with the increasing number of heatwave days predicted. The city has published an [open dataset](https://grenoble-backoffice.data4citizen.com//dataset/arbres-grenoble) listing all the trees in Grenoble, in the hope that it can be used by citizens in innovative ways.

Some data is missing. For example, some trees do not have a planting year. It is important for arborists to know when trees were planted so that they can take care of them and plan successful replanting. The aim of this project is to predict the year of plantation of trees in Grenoble Métropole, allowing better management of trees.
